# HTML Yielder
***

## How To Use

Using HTML Yielder can't be easier. You need to place index.php, .htaccess and inc directory in the directory where your static HTML files are stored.

**You need a hosting with PHP**  

## Let's define some variables

Open **inc/variables.php** and define some variables. You can find instructions in that file, it's very straightforward.

Open your HTML files and include those variables. Remember, you call a variable in this fornat: **{variable}**.

### Do NOT open files directly (File > Open, Open With...), in that case this won't work! ###
